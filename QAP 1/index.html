                <br>
                <p>Moose are among the largest land mammals in North America and Eurasia. While male moose (<dfn>bulls</dfn>) weigh up to 1,543 pounds, females (<dfn>cows</dfn>) weigh up to 1,080 pounds. Adults stand between 5.6 to 7.6 feet tall at the shoulder. Their immense size makes them one of the most formidable animals in the wilderness. </p>
                <p>Moose are robust and muscular. They have long legs that support their massive frame, allowing them to navigate through forests and wade through bodies of water. Moose have a dense and coarse coat of fur that helps insulate them from harsh weather conditions. During the winter, their fur becomes thicker, providing essential protection against the cold. Their fur varies in color depending on the season and region. In summer, it is typically dark brown, whereas in winter, it can appear lighter, almost grayish. Their fur color helps them blend into their surroundings.</p>
                <p>Moose are distinguished by their long muzzles. They have a special nose that helps them smell and they have a prominent, overhanging upper lip, which they use to grasp and pull leaves and twigs from trees and shrubs. Their large, expressive eyes are dark and soulful, and their ears are relatively small and inconspicuous. </p>
                <p>One of the most striking features of bulls are their antlers, which are distinctive and different from the twig-like antlers seen in most other deer. These impressive appendages can span up to 6 feet wide and are covered in velvety skin when they are growing. As they mature, the antlers harden and develop a complex network of points. Antlers grow and fall off every year.</p>
                <p>Moose have long, muscular necks that allow them to reach high branches and aquatic vegetation. Moose have a flap of skin, called the <dfn>dewlap</dfn>, which hangs from the throat, often referred to as the “<dfn>bell</dfn>”. This dewlap is more prominent in males and becomes especially noticeable during the mating season, or <dfn>rut</dfn>. The dewlap can be quite large and pendulous, adding to the moose's distinctive appearance during this time. It serves as both a visual and vocal signal, as males will often use their dewlap to communicate their dominance and readiness to potential mates by swinging it back and forth and emitting deep, resonant calls. While generally quiet animals, moose do make a variety of sounds to communicate with each other.</p>

                <p>Moose legs are sturdy and end in cloven hooves, designed for walking on soft or marshy ground and for swimming. They also act as snowshoes in the winter, enabling moose to move across deep snow. </p>
                <p>Moose have relatively short tails ending in a tuft of hair. It is not as conspicuous as those of some other large mammals.</p>

                <br/>
                <p>In North America, moose are found in Canada where there are an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 moose, with a significant population in Newfoundland. In the United States, in places like Alaska, northern New England, and some western states, the estimated population is 300,000. In Europe and Asia, moose are found in countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, and Russia. The population in Eurasia is about 1.2 million.</p>
                <p>As the seasons change, moose adapt to different habitats. They need edible plants, protection from predators, and shelter from extreme weather. Populations have been declining in some areas due to habitat loss, disease, and predation. Human activities like hunting have caused a shrinking of the moose’s natural range, but there have been attempts to reintroduce them to their historical habitats.</p>

                <h2>Behaviour</h2>

                <p>Moose are usually active during the day and are often solitary animals, unlike most other deer species. The strongest bonds are between mother moose and their calves, who stay with their mothers until just before the next calves are born in the Spring. When the mother moose begins estrus (a recurring period of sexual receptivity and fertility), she chases them away.</p>
                <p>Although moose are generally slow-moving and calm, moose can become aggressive and move quickly if they are angered or startled. This is also more likely during their mating season, which happens in the Fall. Mothers can be protective of their calves and might attack if humans get too close. Also, during mating season, males compete for females by fighting with their antlers. </p>

                        <li>Moose are the largest species in the deer family.</li>
                        <li>Moose are not particularly fast runners. They can reach speeds of up to 56 kilometers per hour, but only for short bursts.</li>
                        <li>Moose have a highly developed sense of smell. Their long, flexible nose is designed to help them locate food and detect predators.</li>
                        <li>Moose are surprisingly good jumpers and can clear obstacles such as fallen trees and fences with ease.</li>
                        <li>Moose are well adapted to cold climates. They have long, hollow guard hairs that trap air and provide insulation. Additionally, their leg length allows them to wade through deep snow.</li>
                        <li>Female moose usually give birth to one calf, although twins can happen if there's enough food. These calves can double in size within a month.</li>
